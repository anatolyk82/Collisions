\title Collisions


This is an example of game which is made with {V-Play} {http://v-play.net} engine. The source code of the game is available on \l {https://github.com/anatolyk82/Collisions} {GigHub}. The main idea of the game is that the user has his own ball and he needs to move it over the game field to avoid collisions with other balls which appear during the game. The game has several levels and depending how the user finishes a level he gets a  certain amount of stars for it.
